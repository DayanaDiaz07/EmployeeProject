# Employee Project

Welcome to the Employee Project! This repository consists of two main directories: `EmployInformation` and `employee-service-front`, representing the backend and frontend parts of the application, respectively.

## Backend - EmployInformation

The `EmployInformation` directory contains the backend of the project, developed using the Spring Boot framework. To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. Open your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and import the `EmployInformation` directory as a project.
2. Locate the `EmployeeInformationApplication.class` file and run it to start the backend server.

## Frontend - employee-service-front

The `employee-service-front` directory is the frontend of the project, built using the Angular framework. To run the frontend, please follow these instructions:

1. Open your preferred IDE or terminal and navigate to the `employee-service-front` directory.
2. Write the following command to start the Angular development server: ng serve
3.  After successfully running the command, open your web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:4200/

This will load the Employee Project's frontend, allowing you to interact with the application.

Thank you for being a part of our Employee Project! If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.
